## Comparison with GX Works3
 
GX Works3 is another software program for programming and debugging Mitsubishi PLCs. It is the latest version of the iQ Works software suite that integrates various engineering tools. GX Works3 supports the iQ-R and iQ-F series PLCs, as well as the Q, L and FX series PLCs. In this section, we will compare GX Developer and GX Works3 in terms of features, compatibility and usability.
 
### Features
 
GX Developer and GX Works3 have some common features, such as:

- Supporting various programming languages, such as ladder diagram, function block, structured text, SFC and MELSAP-L.
- Providing simulation and communication functions for debugging and testing PLC programs.
- Allowing import and export of projects from files or PLC devices.
- Offering online and offline editing modes.

However, GX Works3 also has some additional features that GX Developer does not have, such as:

- Supporting the iQ-R and iQ-F series PLCs, which are the latest models of Mitsubishi PLCs.
- Integrating with other engineering tools in the iQ Works software suite, such as iQ AppPortal, FieldDeviceConfigurator and GX LogViewer.
- Providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that is more modern and intuitive than GX Developer.
- Offering advanced functions, such as label-based programming, parameter settings, module configuration and system diagnostics.

### Compatibility
 
GX Developer and GX Works3 have different compatibility requirements for the PLC models and the operating systems. The table below summarizes the compatibility information for both software programs:
  | Software | PLC Models | Operating Systems | | --- | --- | --- | | GX Developer | Q Process, Q, L, FX Series and legacy controllers A and AnS Series | Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 (32-bit or 64-bit) | | GX Works3 | iQ-R, iQ-F, Q, L and FX Series | Windows 7/8/10 (32-bit or 64-bit) |  
As you can see, GX Developer supports more PLC models than GX Works3, but it also requires older operating systems. GX Works3 supports newer PLC models and operating systems, but it does not support legacy controllers. Therefore, you should choose the software program that matches your PLC model and your operating system.
 
### Usability
 
GX Developer and GX Works3 have different user interfaces and user experiences. GX Developer has a traditional GUI that consists of menus, toolbars, windows and dialogs. It has a simple and straightforward layout that is easy to navigate. However, it also has a dated and cluttered appearance that may not appeal to some users. GX Works3 has a modern GUI that consists of ribbons, tabs, panes and wizards. It has a sleek and elegant layout that is easy to customize. However, it also has a complex and sophisticated appearance that may overwhelm some users. Therefore, you should choose the software program that suits your preference and skill level.
 
## Conclusion
 
GX Developer and GX Works3 are both software programs for programming and debugging Mitsubishi PLCs. They have some common features, but they also have some differences in terms of features, compatibility and usability. You should compare both software programs carefully before deciding which one to use for your PLC projects. You can download both software programs from the official website of Mitsubishi Electric with a product ID. We hope this article has helped you learn how to compare GX Developer and GX Works3 for your PLC projects.
