The Intouchables is based on a true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou, who met in 1993 when Philippe was looking for a caregiver after a paragliding accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down. Abdel was a young Algerian immigrant who had a criminal record and was living on welfare. Despite their differences in background, culture, and personality, they developed a strong bond of friendship and mutual respect that changed their lives for the better.
 
The film was directed by Olivier Nakache and Ãric Toledano, who also co-wrote the script. The film stars FranÃ§ois Cluzet as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss (the fictional name of Abdel). The film also features Audrey Fleurot, Anne Le Ny, Clotilde Mollet, and Alba GaÃ¯a Bellugi in supporting roles. The film was shot in Paris and its suburbs, as well as in Normandy and Morocco.
 
The Intouchables received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, who praised the film's humor, heart, and performances. The film also sparked a debate about the representation of race, class, and disability in French cinema and society. The film was remade in several countries, including the United States (The Upside), India (Oopiri), Argentina (Inseparables), and China (The Wandering Earth).
