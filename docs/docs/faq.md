## What About Akita?

Akita is still actively maintained, and thriving (2.4 million downloads to date!).
It is a complete solution - Elf is merely another option.
Furthermore, Akita is Datorama driven, and therefore performing significant changes was difficult.
Elf was created to be more community driven.
