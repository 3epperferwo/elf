# Active ID(s)

This feature requires the `withEntities` to be used in the Store. It lets you hold one or more IDs indicating the entities that are currently active. It is often useful
for monitoring which entities the user is interacting with. The following methods are available:

`setActiveIds`, `getActiveIds`, `selectActiveIds`, `resetActiveIds`, `toggleActiveIds`, `removeActiveIds`, `addActiveIds` and `selectActiveEntities`.
